# Today's Assignment

Read About the History of General Artificial Intelligence Research, the future of AGI, and modern AI safety concerns. Write down your thoughts in the form of two-three questions you would ask your classmates. Please review the following resources:

* [History of Artificial Intelligence](http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2017/history-artificial-intelligence/)
* [How far-are we from achieving artificial general intelligence](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cognitiveworld/2019/06/10/how-far-are-we-from-achieving-artificial-general-intelligence/#e8aa1876dc4d)

Enjoy!Â  :coffee:

### Not exactly sure if this is what you want turned in... but this is what I did for the assignment time tonight.

- I watched [Alphago](https://youtu.be/WXuK6gekU1Y) and found it very interesting how they were able to train the computer to actually beat the human at such a complicated strategical game.

- I also watched the [In the Age of AI (full film) | FRONTLINE](https://youtu.be/5dZ_lvDgevk)

- I also watched the video "podcast" you have listed here [Yann LeCunn Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGSOCuByo24)

### Questions to ask my classmates:
- I was watching a video on YouTube that is part of a series called "The Age of A.I" and the episode I was watching was called "Love, art, and stories: decoded". In this episode, they talk about a computer named "Benjamin" that writes screenplays and movie scripts. Has anyone ever heard of this and what is your take on this idea?
    - My answer:
        - This was both fascinating to me but at the same time scares me. We have already seen that we can train a neural network to generate text and essential that is what this machine is trained to do based on almost 200 screenplays as its training data. I may be over thinking this concept but what is going to prevent a program like that from adding subliminal messages into these screenplays, and we would be none the wiser? Not to mention the millions of jobs that would be lost. One of the movies that have already been made based on one of these scripts is called "Sunspring | A Sci-Fi Short Film Starring Thomas Middleditch" and is available on YouTube.
    
- Based on how quickly A.I. has advanced, just in our lifetime, do you think that it is now possible for a machine to "feel" emotions? Or do you think that it would just be trained to read body language of a human to tell what they are feeling and then mimic that?

- Have you heard about Rebekah Jones, the data analyst in FL that got fired from the Health Dept for supposedly refusing to manipulate the Covid data? If that is what really happened, what would you do if you were put into that situation?
